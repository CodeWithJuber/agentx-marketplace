### Reddit (r/SaaS, r/artificial, r/Entrepreneur)

**Title:** I built an AI agent marketplace - creators are earning $47K/month

**Post:**

Hey everyone,

I just launched AgentX on Product Hunt - a marketplace where creators build and sell AI agents.

**The problem:**
Everyone's building AI tools, but there's no easy way to monetize them. Creators want passive income, businesses want ready-made AI solutions.

**The solution:**
AgentX is like "App Store for AI agents." Creators:
1. Build AI agents with our no-code tool
2. Set their own prices
3. Earn 85% of every sale

**Results so far:**
- Top creator: $47K in first month
- 3,500+ creators onboarded
- $2.4M+ in total sales

**The viral loop:**
Our referral program gives 20% lifetime commission. Every creator becomes a marketer.

Would love your feedback and support on Product Hunt: [LINK]

Happy to answer any questions!
